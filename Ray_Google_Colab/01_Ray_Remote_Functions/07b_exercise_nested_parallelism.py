Exercise 3: Nested Parallelism for 3 Tasks
GOAL: The goal of this exercise is to show how to create nested tasks by calling a remote function inside of
another remote function.

In this exercise, you will implement the structure of a parallel hyperparameter sweep which trains a number of
models in parallel. Each model will be trained using parallel gradient computations.

Turn compute_gradient and train_model into remote functions so that they can be executed in parallel.
Inside of train_model, do the calls to compute_gradient in parallel and fetch the results using ray.get.
