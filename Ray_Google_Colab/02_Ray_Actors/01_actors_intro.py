Implementation of Ray Actors in Ray
"""
import ray

"""
Although remote functions are useful for parallelizing stateless computations,
sometimes your workload requires maintaining state across invocations. Some examples
might be a simple counter, a neural network during training, or a simulator environment.

If using remote functions, you would have to pass this state into each function invocation
and return the updated state when it finishes.

However, Ray comes with a stateful abstraction for these situations: remote actors. An actor
is a lot like a Python object - it is initialized with an __init__ function (that has the same
features has remote tasks), and can contain internal state that is accessed and mutated by
remote method calls.

Remote method calls will be executed one at a time on each actor, so there's no need to worry
about race conditions on the actor's state. To achieve more parallelism, multiple actors can
be created.
