"""
Sharing References to an Actor:
GOAL: The goal of this exercise is to show how to pass references to actors to remote functions and methods.

Sometimes, we may want to have multiple remote tasks that invoke methods on the same actor. For example, we
may have a single actor that records logging information for a group of tasks and allows other tasks to query
the logs.

We can achieve this by passing a handle to the actor (the object returned from calling Actor.remote()) as an
argument to the tasks.
